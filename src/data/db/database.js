He is quick to troubleshoot issues, create wonderful content, and display clean and concise code. He is a developer that inspires me to shoot to greater heights of knowledge and skills because of his astounding knowledge and skills.

He has a wide knowledge of full-stack development that puts our teams at ease, as he has proven dependable and helpful when issues arise. His skills on the front-end are unmatched, and his understanding of the back-end make him great to bounce ideas off of. He is wonderful to have around, not only due to his expertise, but because of his friendly demeanor and attitude. His creativity always left me impressed and I have no doubt in my mind that any team would find themselves more productive by having Joseph a part of it.",

He was a great addition to the team both for his easy-to-work-with personality and his technical knowledge. He has a careful attention to detail and a flair for organization that kept our project tidy and readable. Even while engrossed with his own parts of the project development, Joseph was always eager to help others with their own issues on the project. Despite the numerous issues we encountered throughout the development process, Joseph had the persistence and determination for problem-solving that made overcoming these roadblocks that much easier. Joseph would be an outstanding addition to any team.",

Whenever there was an issue or a roadblock that prevented us from moving forward, he was always there to offer assistance and solutions. Joseph is always ready with an answer, and when faced with new technologies, he is always determined to learn them as fast, and thoroughly as possible. His highly analytical point of view and quick problem solving was a great asset to our team. I consider myself fortunate to have been able to work alongside him to create all of our past projects and look forward to working with him again in the future. ",

      content: `I've had the privilege of having Joseph being one of my students during an intensive Coding Boot Camp at the University of California, Riverside. He is a hard-working, driven, and ambitious individual who shows great promise in his professional career due to his eagerness to learn new things and master his existing skillset. Aside from his technical skills, his upbeat personality and appeal encourage a friendly working atmosphere. The best compliment that I could give him was neither my TAs nor myself believe him when he said he had no coding experience after seeing his work and progress. I believe Joseph will be a valuable asset to any company that brings him on board.`,
